# Pedro de Araújo

After 6 years working in the food industry, I decided to change my career path to an area where I have a strong affinity: software development.
I have been studying programming languages for 1 year now, including Javascript, NodeJS, ReactJS, and React-Native, and I feel confident about entering the job market as a FullStack developer.
